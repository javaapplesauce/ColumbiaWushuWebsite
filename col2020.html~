	        	<h3>Columbia</h3>
	        	<p>Columbia University is located at 116th St and Broadway. Traveling here is no hassle at all! We’re right on Broadway so taxis and shuttles come and go quick. There’s a subway station and a bus station right at the main entrance too. The subway station is on the 1 (Red) line and although there are a few bus lines available to you, you’ll probably find the M60 most useful.</p>

	        <div class="col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-1">
	        	<p>The competition will take place in Roone Arledge Auditorium in Lerner Hall. Lerner Hall is located on the Broadway side of main campus. It is most easily identified by its large glass wall which reveals its extensive ramp system. Because of the ramps, the building has an unorthodox floor system. However, because Roone is located on the bottom floor, it is easy to find.</p>

				<h2>LaGuardia Airport (LGA) to Manhattan</h2>
				<p><b>Taxi:</b> There are taxis available outside every terminal. Just look for a taxi stand! Rideshare services (Uber, Lyft, Juno, Via) are also available.</p>
				<p><b>Shuttle Bus:</b> Using a shuttle is a cheap and easy way to get directly to the middle of the city. The NYC Airporter is always available at the airport from 5:00AM to 11:30PM. One-way fare is $16 and round-trip fare is $30. You can choose to disembark at Grand Central, Port Authority, or Penn Station, so before you leave, please take some time to find out which stop is closest to your hotel. Please note that there is also complimentary hotel shuttle service between 23rd and 63rd street from Grand Central. You can also hire private shuttles if you are traveling with multiple people.</p>
				<p><b>Public Bus:</b> The M60 will actually stop at Columbia University and just across the street, you’ll find a subway station on the 1 line too! If you wanted to take an early sneak peek at our campus, this is the way! The bus and subway fare is $2.75 each. Please note that the M60 is SBS, which stands for “Select Bus Service”, which means you need to pay for the fare at the bus stop before riding.</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to Manhattan</h2>
				<p><b>Taxi:</b> The taxis charge a $52 flat rate (plus tolls) to any Manhattan location. Just like the other airports, there are taxis at every terminal. Just look for the taxi stand. Rideshare services (Uber, Lyft, Juno, Via) are also available.</p>
				<p><b>Shuttle Bus:</b> The NYC Airporter shuttle is available too, as long as it’s within the hours of 5:00AM to 11:30PM. One-way fare is $19 and round-trip fare is $35. They will stop at Grand Central, Port Authority, and Penn Station, so before you leave, find out which stop is closest to your hotel. Again, please note that there is also complimentary hotel shuttle service between 23rd and 63rd street from Grand Central.</p>
				<p><b>AirTrain:</b> If you are planning to take AirTrain, you will most likely stop at Jamaica Station, which will cost $7.75 to reach. At Jamaica Station there will be many subways, LIRR trains, and Q line buses that can take you throughout midtown Manhattan. The subway (and bus) fare is $2.75. The LIRR will take you to Penn Station and is faster, but costs $7.75 off-peak/$10.75 peak.</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) to Manhattan</h2>
				<p><b>Taxi:</b> With metered fare (plus tolls), taxis will charge you approximately $50-$75 to any Manhattan location. Rideshare services (Uber, Lyft, Juno, Via) are also available.</p>
				<p><b>Shuttle Bus:</b> The NYC Airporter shuttle is available from 5:30AM to 11:30PM like at the other airports. The biggest difference is that the shuttle will not take you directly to Manhattan. Instead it will take you  to LGA or JFK. There, you can take another NYC Airporter shuttle that will take you Manhattan or any other method of transportation. The transfer between the airports will cost you $24.</p>
				<p><b>AirTrain and NJ Transit:</b> Take the AirTrain from any terminal to the NJ Transit station. The NJ Transit train will take you to New York Penn Station (<b>not Newark Penn Station</b>). Cost is around $15.25 and will take roughly 30 minutes.</p>
				<p><b>Other:</b> You can also take a train like the Amtrak or the Path Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) that can take you to Manhattan. The Amtrak takes the same track as NJ Transit, but is significantly more expensive.</p>
