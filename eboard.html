		<h3>Charmaine Dero</h3>

	<div class ="col-lg-7 col-lg-offset-1"><p>Charmaine Dero's martial arts journey started in 1997 with Karate because she wanted to be a power ranger. She started Wushu in 2004 after seeing her sister, Caitlin, do cool Wushu things, and she started learning from former Shaanxi Wushu Team teammates Sifu Zhang Yuan and Sifu Zhao Changjun. She was fortunate to learn Nanquan/Nandao/Nangun from former Philippine Wushu team member Denven Parantac and China team members Chen Hui Ying and Liang Yong Da. Most recently she assistant coached for the US Wushu Junior/Senior teams at the 13th Pan-American Wushu Championships in Brazil. When not doing Wushu, she's a full time night shift nurse on an ICU stepdown unit; the rest of her spare time is dedicated to lifting and sleeping. She specializes in Nanquan/Nandao/Nangun and breaking down movements to the tiniest detail. She joined CU Wushu through mutual Wushu friends in 2014.</p></div>
